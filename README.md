Main Assignment Proposal
For my main assignment I will be creating a spider like object in BGE. It will have eight legs attached to a main body composed of two rigid bodies (the anthrax and the thorax.
 Each leg will be split up into separate parts. Real life spider legs have seven sections so I will likely be using 7 rigid bodies for each leg.
 
The legs will be mainly attached to one another with hinge joints and attached to the body with a ball joint allowing for both horizontal and vertical movement although it might end
 up being best to use a hinge joint only allowing for horizontal movement and have the sections within the leg deal with raising and lowering that leg. The anthrax and the thorax will
 be connected with a ball joint.
 
The main deliverable of this assignment will be a spider that walks. If further complexity is required or if I wish to extend upon this deliverable I will also implement 
a jumping action for the spider.

Spiders walk by using two groups of four legs. While four legs are in the air, the others are on the ground.
